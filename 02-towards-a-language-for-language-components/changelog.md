# Changes

Based on the reviewers' feedback, we made the following changes

* In S2.2 (Page 6), briefly discuss the choice to use deep handlers in CS.

* In S2.5 (Page 9), add a remark to the pretty printing example explaining that
  two module imports can be "conflicting", and that the type system should
  reject a program that tries to import conflicting modules.
  
* In 3.1 (Page 10), clarify that the effect variable in the signature of `eval`
  is universally quantified.
